Cobub Toaster is an Open Source Mobile App Push Notification Solution which can be deployed isolated, other than the public cloud like GCM (Google Cloud Message).

Cobub Toaster includes two components, Push Notification Server and SDK.

Push Notification Server will be deployed inside the enterprise own server; SDK needs to be integrated into mobile APPs. The SDK will maintain a persistent connection with the PNS via TCP, and the developer is able to push custom messages to the APP from server side.

And our SDK is open source, in that you wonâ€™t worry about sensitive information leak or privacy issue.

Cobub Toaster is suitable for the enterprise-level scenarios.
